## ‚öôÔ∏è Challenges Faced and Solutions

### 1. **Handling Popups in TypeScript**

- **Challenge**: The popup modal component from `reactjs-popup` required custom typing to work correctly with dynamic content.
- **Solution**: Used type assertions (`as unknown as React.ReactNode`) to safely cast the inline function rendering the modal, solving type errors without breaking functionality.

### 2. **Displaying JSON Data from MySQL**

- **Challenge**: MySQL‚Äôs `JSON` type required proper parsing on the backend to deliver `schedule` as an array.
- **Solution**: Used `JSON.parse()` on the backend before sending data to the frontend to ensure the schedule was properly rendered.

### 3. **Mobile Responsiveness**

- **Challenge**: Making the profile and list pages fully responsive while keeping a clean layout.
- **Solution**: Leveraged Tailwind CSS‚Äôs responsive utilities (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) to create adaptive designs.

### 4. **Conditional Rendering for Edge Cases**

- **Challenge**: Handling states like "No data found" in search and booking form submission success.
- **Solution**: Implemented conditional rendering based on filtered results and `success`/`error` flags to provide feedback to users gracefully.
